<!---- 👋 Hi, I’m @cmoz
- 👀 I’m interested in Arduino based physical computing, wearable technology and making fun circuits!

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on wearables, interaction, sensor based projects, research
- 📫 How to reach me @cmoz on Twitter or cmoz@me.com


cmoz/cmoz is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.

I joined over a decade ago but mostly have saved my work on my computer. I determined to have a better practice this year and use GH for my code.
